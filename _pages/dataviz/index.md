## Fall 2021 Syllabus
Our course meets in-person, wearing face masks in compliance with the [campus Covid policy](https://www.trincoll.edu/reopening/), on Tuesdays & Thursdays 2:55-4:10pm in **Seabury S205** with Professor Jack Dougherty at Trinity College, Hartford CT. [Email me a quick question](mailto:jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) or [schedule an in-person or Zoom appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me).

Course description: How can charts and maps tell meaningful stories? How can they mislead us from the truth? In this introductory hands-on course, we will create data visualizations in order to better understand design principles and develop a critical analysis of the field. Students will learn skills in both quantitative reasoning and digital storytelling as we advance from beginner tools to editing code templates. For the community learning component, our class will build interactive charts and maps on a public policy issue with a Hartford-area partner organization. No coding experience is necessary, but curiosity is required.  
Fulfills requirement in Numerical and Symbolic Reasoning (NUM).   
Cross-referenced with Community Learning, Public Policy & Law, Writing & Rhetoric, Urban Studies.  
Enrollment limited to 19 students.  

### Community Learning Partners
This semester we will create data stories in partnership with two Hartford organizations that focus on housing. While we will work virtually with our partners on their digital projects, there may be optional opportunities for you to visit their public events or building sites in person.

### Course Materials and Tools
![book covers](/images/2021/covers-hodv-datafeminism.png)
- Two open-access books are freely available online (or you can purchase print editions).
  - Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou, *Hands-On Data Visualization: Interactive Storytelling from Spreadsheets to Code* (O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2021), <https://HandsOnDataViz.org>.
  - Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, *Data Feminism* (MIT Press, 2020), <https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu>.
- Bring a laptop computer (Mac, Windows, or Chromebook) to every class. Install more than one browser (such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome) for testing purposes. Tell me if you need a temporary laptop loaner.
- You will need to sign up for several free web services (such as Google Drive, Datawrapper, GitHub). See my list of [recommended free digital tools in this course](https://handsondataviz.org/recommended-tools.html).

### Learning Goals and Assessments
In this course you will demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have developed to meet 12 broad learning goals (with more specific sub-goals listed in the schedule further below):

1. Strengthen Your Spreadsheet Skills
2. Find and Question Your Data
3. Clean Up Messy Data
4. Make Meaningful Comparisons
5. Chart Your Data
6. Map Your Data
7. Edit and Host Code with GitHub
8. Build with Leaflet Map Code Templates
9. Transform Your Map Data
10. Listen, Tell, and Show Your Community Partner's Data Stories
11. Embed on the Web
12. Detect Lies and Reduce Bias

Your progress toward these learning goals will be assessed in three ways:

#### A. Open-Book Weekly Quizzes
- The purpose is to demonstrate your knowledge and skills through questions that emphasize conceptual understanding and how to apply it in new contexts. You will have more than one opportunity to successfully complete each quiz while working independently with your notes, readings, and any web resources.
- Each week, select any 2-hour period during the 2-day window (typically from Sunday 12 noon to Tuesday 2pm) to complete a Moodle quiz of about 5 questions on the designated learning goal. You may see different versions of questions than other students, but all questions address the same goal.
- Short-answer questions will be scored automatically by the computer, and show-your-work questions will be scored manually by the instructor. If you respond incorrectly to an auto-scored question, the quiz will offer advice and allow you to try again. If you respond incorrectly to a manually-scored question, the instructor will email you with advice and allow you to try again within one day. Furthermore, the quiz settings allow you to retake it a second time within the 2-day window.
- After the quiz closes (typically on Tuesday 2pm), if you still have not successfully completed it, you can meet with the instructor to discuss your learning and request another opportunity to retake the quiz by the end of the week (typically Friday afternoon).
- Before you start the quiz, prepare by reading assigned chapters, doing practice exercises, and discussing the material with classmates who have not yet started it.
- When you start the 2-hour quiz period, you may use your materials (including your notes, the online book, and the entire Internet), but you must work independently and you may not communicate about the quiz content in any way (except with the instructor) until it has closed (typically Tuesday 2pm). You are responsible for following the Intellectual Honesty policy as described in the [Trinity Student Handbook](https://www.trincoll.edu/policies/). If doubts arise, the instructor may require you to retake a quiz under direct supervision and/or refer the issue to the Honor Council.
- 12 broad learning goals x 5 points per quiz = 60 points

#### B. Building Data Stories
- The purpose is to show your work in building different stages of data visualizations and written narratives that explain why and how it matters to our community partners.
- Depending on the stage of the build, your work will be evaluated by the instructor, your peers, or guest experts, based on a rubric.
- 6 stages worth 5 points each = 30 points. For any overdue assignments in this section, a 10 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies.

#### C. Class Participation
- The purpose is to encourage active learning and accountability. Each student begins the course with 10 participation points. During class, you may be randomly called on to discuss a concept in our reading, or to share your computer screen for everyone to view while we learn tools and build data stories. You do not necessarily need to know the correct answer. But if you are not present or not able to participate when called, a point will be deducted from your participation score. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies, or scheduling conflicts where you have notified me well in advance.

**If you are quarantined or isolated due to Covid**, or if you have concerns about your health, contact me in advance to request permission to participate remotely via Zoom during a specific class session. Last-minute requests may not be granted permission.

#### Summary  
60 points quizzes + 30 points data stories + 10 class participation = 100 possible points, plus any bonus points. In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+. Access your individual assessments on the password-protected Moodle site for this course at <https://moodle.trincoll.edu>.

Academic accommodations: please notify me before our third class session, and [schedule an appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me) to discuss how we will implement your approved plan. For those students with accommodations approved after the start of the semester, a minimum of 10 days’ notice is required. For Student Accessibility Resources, contact <mailto:Lori.Clapis@trincoll.edu> or <mailto:SARC@trincoll.edu>.

Religious observances: please notify me before our third class session regarding any scheduling accommodations.

### How to Succeed in this Course
- Bookmark this online syllabus and check it often for updates, which will appear **in bold**.
- Keep a calendar (paper or digital) to manage your time and meet deadlines.
- Bring a laptop (with a fully-charged battery) to every class, and turn off distractions to help you (and others) focus on learning. On a Mac, set Notifications to "Do Not Disturb."
- Use a password manager to keep track of your digital accounts. See my [introduction to Bitwarden](https://handsondataviz.org/password-manager.html), an open-source password manager with free core features for Windows/Mac/Linux computers, all major web browsers, and iOS and Android mobile devices.
- Take initiative and ask questions: during or after class, via email, or by appointment [on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me). If you don't understand something, other students probably are puzzled, too. Go ahead and ask.
- Meet up with other students outside of class. Create a small study group to review the course material and work together. The secret to success in college is teaching yourselves how to learn new material.
- If anything is interfering with your learning, email or talk with me about it. I care about how you're doing in life, not just in our classroom.

- Overview of Learning Goal #6: Map Your Data. Start reading HODV chapter <https://handsondataviz.org/map.html>
  - Map types (focus primarily on point maps and choropleth maps)
  - Map design principles and rules
  - Choropleth colors and intervals (focus on basic concepts for now)
  - Normalize choropleth map data
  - Create point maps with Google My Maps and Datawrapper. In prior class we used [CLJ data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFMkOr4pug-fI4sRObyUQfRLXAcFrZ8B6oMM6NzolfY/edit#gid=1372468455) and [Habitat data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OTTOG7m5I0Y0mk8qd3hcy9HGLjXy6cBYmJY-iDoKHxc/edit#gid=0). Also, we used Datawrapper Symbol Point tool to create simple point maps, without adding data values to Symbols.
  - Create choropleth map with Datawrapper (which recently simplified steps to input data, and I have not yet updated the HODV chapter, but it's easier now).
  - Challenge (updated): create a meaningful choropleth map of any data column in this [CT census tracts Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15pVeZE3ZJwctkFapPH34SBb5d4Ry_ji4QWWow9eOxt8/edit#gid=874524571) that I downloaded from [American Community Survey 2015-19 in Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2019_5yr/R12920651).
    - Hint 1: [CT census tract boundaries for 2010 and 2020 are different](https://www.ctdata.org/blog/2020-census-geography-connecticut). If using 2010s data (such as ACS 2015-19), in Datawrapper choropleth map, select USA > Connecticut > Census Tracts (2010).
    - Hint 2: In Datawrapper, the TRACTCODE column does not match the GeoFIPS column in the Google Sheet, so you need to convert the latter with a spreadsheet function, and remove the first character. See how in new HODV chapter <https://handsondataviz.org/numbers-to-text.html>

### Tues 12 Oct
- No class (Trinity Day) and no quiz this week.

### Thur 14 Oct
