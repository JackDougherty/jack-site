## Fall 2021 Syllabus
Tuesdays & Thursdays 2:55-4:20pm in room TBA with Professor Jack Dougherty at Trinity College, Hartford CT. [Email me a quick question](mailto:jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) or [schedule an appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.org/).

Course description: How can charts and maps tell meaningful stories? How can they mislead us from the truth? In this introductory hands-on course, we will create data visualizations in order to better understand design principles and develop a critical analysis of the field. Students will learn skills in both quantitative reasoning and digital storytelling as we advance from beginner tools to editing code templates. For the community learning component, our class will build interactive charts and maps on a public policy issue with a Hartford-area partner organization. No coding experience is necessary, but curiosity is required.  
Fulfills requirement in Numerical and Symbolic Reasoning (NUM)  
Cross-referenced with Community Learning, Public Policy & Law, Writing & Rhetoric, Urban Studies
Enrollment limited to 19 students.  

### Community Learning Partners
This semester we will create data stories in partnership with two Hartford organizations that focus on housing. While we will work virtually with our partners on their digital projects, there may be optional opportunities for students to visit their public events or building sites in person.
