## Fall 2021 Syllabus
Tuesdays & Thursdays 2:55-4:20pm in-person course in room TBA with Professor Jack Dougherty at Trinity College, Hartford CT. [Email me a quick question](mailto:jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) or [schedule an appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.org/).

Course description: How can charts and maps tell meaningful stories? How can they mislead us from the truth? In this introductory hands-on course, we will create data visualizations in order to better understand design principles and develop a critical analysis of the field. Students will learn skills in both quantitative reasoning and digital storytelling as we advance from beginner tools to editing code templates. For the community learning component, our class will build interactive charts and maps on a public policy issue with a Hartford-area partner organization. No coding experience is necessary, but curiosity is required.  
Fulfills requirement in Numerical and Symbolic Reasoning (NUM).   
Cross-referenced with Community Learning, Public Policy & Law, Writing & Rhetoric, Urban Studies.  
Enrollment limited to 19 students.  

### Community Learning Partners
This semester we will create data stories in partnership with two Hartford organizations that focus on housing. While we will work virtually with our partners on their digital projects, there may be optional opportunities for you to visit their public events or building sites in person.

### Course Materials and Tools
![book covers](/images/2021/covers-hodv-datafeminism.png)
- Two open-access books are freely available online (or you can purchase print editions).
  - Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou, *Hands-On Data Visualization: Interactive Storytelling from Spreadsheets to Code* (O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2021), <https://HandsOnDataViz.org>.
  - Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, *Data Feminism* (MIT Press, 2020), <https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu>.
- Bring a working laptop computer (Mac, Windows, Linux, or Chromebook) to every class. Install more than one browser (such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome) for testing purposes. Tell me if you need a temporary laptop loaner.
- You will need to sign up for several free web services (such as Google Drive, Datawrapper, GitHub). See my list of [recommended free digital tools in this course](https://handsondataviz.org/recommended-tools.html).
- Use a password manager to keep track of your digital accounts. See my [introduction to Bitwarden](https://handsondataviz.org/password-manager.html), an open-source password manager with free core features for Windows/Mac/Linux computers, all major web browsers, and iOS and Android mobile devices.

### Learning Goals and Assessments
This course is designed to demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have developed to meet 12 broad learning goals. [TODO: point to link with more specific sub-goals and book chapters]

1. Strengthen Your Spreadsheet Skills
2. Find and Question Your Data
3. Clean Up Messy Data
4. Make Meaningful Comparisons
5. Chart Your Data
6. Map Your Data
7. Embed on the Web
8. Edit and Host Code with GitHub
9. Build with Leaflet Map Code Templates
10. Transform Your Map Data
11. Detect Lies and Reduce Bias
12. Listen, Tell, and Show Your Community Partner's Data Story

Your knowledge and skills will be assessed in three ways:

### A. Open-Book Weekly Quizzes
- The purpose is to demonstrate your knowledge and skills through questions that emphasize conceptual understanding and how to apply it in new contexts, using your course materials and notes. You will have more than one opportunity to successfully complete each quiz.
- Each week, select 1 hour during a 2-day period (typically Sunday 12 noon to Tuesday 2pm) to complete an online quiz of 5-10 questions on one of the broad learning goals above. You may see different versions of questions than other students, but all address the same learning goals.
- Short-answer questions will be scored automatically for quick feedback. Longer-task questions require you to show your work by pasting a link or explanation, and these will be scored manually by the instructor on a completed/non-completed basis.
- If you respond incorrectly to an auto-scored question, the quiz will show advice, but not the correct answer. Instead, the quiz will give you a second chance to answer a different version of the same question. Furthermore, if you incorrectly answer a manually-scored question, the instructor may re-open that portion of your quiz for a second attempt with additional time.
- After the quiz closes (typically on Tuesday 2pm), if you still have not successfully completed it, you can meet with the instructor to discuss your learning and request another opportunity to retake the quiz before the next quiz opens (typically Sunday 12 noon).
- Before you start the quiz, prepare ahead by reading assigned chapters, doing practice exercises, and discussing with classmates who have not yet started it. When you start the 1-hour quiz, you must work independently and may not communicate about its content in any way until the instructor reviews results in class. You are responsible for intellectual honesty. If doubts arise, the instructor may require you to retake a quiz under direct supervison, and/or refer the issue to the Honor Council.
- 12 broad learning goals x 5 points (based on 5-10 questions) = 60 points

### B. Building Data Stories
- The purpose is to show your work in building different stages of data visualizations and written narratives that explain why and how it matters to our community partners.
- The instructor and experts in the field will score stages of your data stories, based on a rubric.
- 6 parts worth 5-10 points each = 40 points

### C. Class Participation
- The purpose is to encourage active learning and accountability. Each student begins the course with 10 participation points. You will be randomly called upon during various classes to discuss a concept in our reading, or to share your computer screen for everyone to view while we learn tools and build data stories. You do not need to know the correct answer. But for each time you are not present or not able to participate when called at random, a point will be deducted from your participation score.

Total = 60 points quizzes + 40 points data stories + 10 class participation = 100 points

<!-- You can access your individual scores on the password-protected Moodle site for this class. [TODO link]
