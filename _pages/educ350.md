## Spring 2023 Syllabus
Our course meets in-person, wearing face masks in compliance with the [campus Covid policy](https://www.trincoll.edu/reopening/), on Fridays 1:30–4:10pm, McCook 313, Trinity College, Hartford CT.

## Instructor
Professor Jack Dougherty, Trinity College, Hartford CT. [Email me a quick question](mailto:jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) or [schedule a Zoom appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me). Portions of this syllabus were originally created with former co-instructor Kyle Evans, Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics.

Course Description: This seminar will explore theoretical, policy, and practical issues of teaching and learning. Who should teach in public schools, and what kind of preparation is necessary? What type of curriculum should be taught, and how do different interest groups shape that decision? How should we assess the quality of student learning? Finally, how do debates on all of these questions influence the nature of teachers’ work and classroom life?
- For the community learning component, Trinity students will design, teach, and assess hands-on inquiry-based science or math workshops for grade 3-8 students in cooperation with nearby Hartford public schools.
- Prerequisite: C- or better in Educational Studies 200 or permission of instructor.
- Enrollment limited to 19 students.

### Course Materials
This book will be purchased for you by the instructor's course funds:

Peter Liljedahl, *Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics, Grades K-12: 14 Teaching Practices for Enhancing Learning* (Corwin Press, 2020).

## Learning Goals and Assessments

1. Students will gain contextual understanding of K-12 teaching by comparing different pedagogical approaches, national standards, modes of assessment, and strategies to promote equity.

2. Students will design, teach, and assess inquiry-based math and/or science lessons in Grade 3-8 classrooms, and evaluate their own teaching as well as work by peers.

3. Students will create online portfolios and presentations of their teaching that illustrate growth in their curricular decision-making and classroom experiences, for evaluation by a panel of educators.

Your progress toward achieving these goals will be assessed in these ways:

#### A. Lesson Plans and Portfolios
Students will prepare three inquiry-based math or science lesson plans, on topics requested by Hartford teachers, designed for about forty minutes of classroom time. Each lesson plan will feature appropriate learning objectives, engaging hands-on activities, meaningful assessment, and strategies to promote equity. (3 x 10 points = 30 points)

After teaching each workshop, students will create a public web portfolio with narrative, video, and images of their lesson plan, reflections on their teaching experience, and ways to improve for next time. Students have the right to remove their web content after the course, or keep it online to share as part of their resume for future employment or graduate school. (3 x 10 points = 30 points)

#### B. Guest Educator Panel Evaluation
Students will deliver an 8-minute presentation of selected highlights from their public web portfolio, to be evaluated by a panel of experienced guest educators. This event will be scheduled during our final exam timeslot on Tuesday May 9th from 3-6pm. (20 points)

#### C. Class Exercises and Participation
To encourage active learning and accountability, each student begins the course with 20 participation points. During class, you may be randomly called on to discuss a concept in our reading, share your responses to a pre-assigned exercise, or peer-review writing by another student. If you are not present or not able to participate when called upon, 2 points will be deducted from your participation score. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies, or scheduling conflicts where you have notified me well in advance. (20 points)

**If you are quarantined or isolated due to Covid**, or if you have concerns about your health, **email me in advance** to request permission to participate remotely via Zoom during a specific class session. Last-minute requests may not be granted.

#### Summary
60 points for lesson plans and portfolios + 20 points for guest educator panel evaluation + 20 points for class exercises and participation = 100 total points. In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+. Access your individual assessments on the password-protected Moodle site for this course at <https://moodle.trincoll.edu>.

Late penalty: A 20 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period that has passed since the assignment deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies.

Academic accommodations: please notify me before our third class session, and [schedule an appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me) to discuss how we will implement your approved plan. For those students with accommodations approved after the start of the semester, a minimum of 10 days’ notice is required. Learn more at the [Student Accessibility Resource Center](https://www.trincoll.edu/sarc/).

Religious observances or other advance scheduling conflicts: please request accommodations well ahead of time, ideally by our third class session. Last-minute requests may not be granted.

### How to Succeed in this Course
- Bookmark this online syllabus and check it for important updates, which will appear **in bold**.
- Keep a calendar (paper or digital) to manage your time and meet deadlines.
- Bring a laptop (with a fully-charged battery) to every class, and turn off distractions to help you (and others) focus on learning. Set notifications on digital devices to "Do Not Disturb."
- Take initiative and ask questions: during or after class, via email, or by appointment [on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me). If you don't understand something, other students probably are puzzled, too. Go ahead and ask.
- Meet up with other students outside of class. Create a small study group to review the course material and work together. The secret to success in college is teaching yourselves how to learn new material.
- If anything is interfering with your learning, email or talk with your instructors about it. We care about how you're doing in life, not just in our classroom.
