**Course Description:** This seminar will explore theoretical, policy, and practical issues of teaching and learning. Who should teach in public schools, and what kind of preparation is necessary? What type of curriculum should be taught, and how do different interest groups shape that decision? How should we assess the quality of student learning? Finally, how do debates on all of these questions influence the nature of teachers’ work and classroom life?

For the community learning component, students will design, teach, and evaluate curricular units in cooperation with neighborhood schools and after-school programs.

**Prerequisite:** C- or better in Educational Studies 200 or permission of instructor.



---


**Course Materials**

 No textbook purchase is required. Course materials will be provided by instructors.



---


**Course Goals**

1) Students will gain contextual understanding of K-12 teaching by comparing different national standards, modes of assessment, equity issues, and pedagogical approaches.

2) Students will design and teach inquiry-based math and/or science lessons in upper-elementary classrooms, and evaluate their own teaching and also work by peers.

3) Students will develop web authoring skills to create an online teaching portfolio that demonstrates their curriculum design and reflections on their teaching experience.

**Community Learning **

For the experiential learning component, students will be placed in an upper-elementary or middle school classroom at a nearby Hartford public school for four sessions: one class observation/teacher interview, and three sessions where each student will teach a 30-45 minute lesson and record video of their work. Students must complete their observation/interview during (or before) the Friday of Trinity Days, and the three teaching sessions will be completed during our Friday class time. See map of schools: [https://commons.trincoll.edu/educ/schools/](https://commons.trincoll.edu/educ/schools/)

**Assessments**

**Reading Responses, Observations, and Proposals:**

These short assignments are assigned in the schedule below, to help you prepare for class. Many will be submitted via Moodle.

**Facilitate Seminar Discussion**

Good facilitation means preparing and leading the seminar in an engaging discussion on core issues in the assigned reading. Students will be assigned specific days and readings to facilitate in the schedule below. Peer and faculty scores will be averaged.

**Lesson Plans and Portfolios**

Students will prepare, teach, reflect, and create web portfolios for three lessons:



1. Teach a pre-designed lesson
2. Design and teach a lesson
3. Design and teach a lesson

Each lesson must include appropriate mathematics and/or science content for your designated classroom, and may include additional topics. Each student will teach independently, but will be assigned to work in small teams to facilitate transportation and video recording. Students will collect video of their teaching (with equipment and editing support from the instructors), pending permission from each school (most HPS parents/guardians already have signed media consent forms for their children).

Students will create a public online web portfolio of their teaching lessons, video excerpts, and reflections (with web editing support from the instructors). Students have the right to keep their web content online or remove it after grading.

Sample 3rd grade portfolios by [Emily Meehan ‘16](https://commons.trincoll.edu/emeehan/lessons/ela-frog-lesson/) & [Elaina Rollins ‘16](https://commons.trincoll.edu/erollins/teaching-samples/lets-be-frogologists/) & [Christina Raiti ‘16](https://commons.trincoll.edu/craiti/lessons/lesson-1-lets-be-frogoligists/)

See [evaluation criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o1yaOXO7u8W5RVyDelTuHsrWI2g8Q22bS9APMuCtOQU/edit), which outlines how your ideas, preparation, and reflection on the experience will be assessed. Whether or not your teaching is “successful” is not the primary purpose, since several factors may be beyond your control, especially for new teachers.

Responses to readings and proposals, which are typically due prior to class discussion, must be completed by the deadline to receive any credit. For all other overdue assignments, a 10 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 24-hour period beyond the deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented medical or family emergencies.

In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Course Policies</span>**

**Attendance:** In this weekly seminar, students will engage in active learning and are expected to participate regularly in seminar discussions. As a result, your attendance and full participation is expected each week. Please notify us during the first week of the course if you require any scheduling accommodations for religious observances, travel, etc.

**Academic Accommodations: **Trinity College is committed to creating an inclusive and accessible learning environment consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you have approval for academic accommodations, please notify faculty during the first two weeks of the semester or a minimum of 10 days prior to needing your accommodations. Please be sure to meet with me privately to discuss implementation. If you do not have approved accommodations, but have a disability requiring academic accommodations, or have questions about applying, please contact Lori Clapis, Coordinator of Accessibility Resources at

860-297-4025 or at [Lori.Clapis@trincoll.edu](mailto:Lori.Clapis@trincoll.edu).

**Intellectual Honesty:** In accordance with the Trinity College Student Integrity Contract students are expected to abide by the highest standards of intellectual honesty in all academic exercises. Intellectual honesty assumes that students do their own work and that they credit properly those upon whose work and thought they draw. It is the responsibility of each student to make sure that he or she is fully aware of what constitutes intellectually honest work in every examination, quiz, paper, laboratory report, homework assignment, or other academic exercise submitted for evaluation in a course at Trinity College.

**Withdrawal:** Under certain circumstances, students can withdraw from a course up until the Friday of the fourth full week of classes (February 15<sup>th</sup>); a W is recorded on the transcript. After this time, they need to petition the Academic Affairs Committee and demonstrate extraordinary circumstances; being at risk of failing the course is not an adequate rationale. Students must get permission from the instructor, and they remain financially responsible for the course.
