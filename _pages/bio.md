[Jack Dougherty's CV](http://bit.ly/cv-jack-dougherty) and [Trinity faculty profile](http://internet2.trincoll.edu/facProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1004266)

Jack Dougherty is Professor and Director of the [Educational Studies Program](http://commons.trincoll.edu/educ) at Trinity College. He was the first Faculty Director of the Liberal Arts Action Lab (2017-2020), and the first Director of the [Center for Hartford Engagement and Research (CHER)](http://cher.trincoll.edu) from 2018-2020. He and his students use digital history, data visualization, and web writing to explore cities, suburbs, and schools in metropolitan Hartford, Connecticut. He received his B.A. in philosophy from Swarthmore College, taught high school social studies in Newark, New Jersey, then earned his Ph.D. in educational policy studies, with a minor in U.S. history, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

As a scholar, Jack specializes in the history and policy of education in the metropolitan United States. His prize-winning first book, *More Than One Struggle: The Evolution of Black School Reform in Milwaukee* (University of North Carolina Press, 2004), examined three generations of African-American activism from the 1930s to the 1990s, including over 60 oral history interviews, and was funded by a Spencer Foundation dissertation fellowship. In the Cities, Suburbs, and Schools project, he published the "Bridging the Gap between Urban, Suburban, and Educational History" book chapter (2007), and “Shopping for Schools: How Public Education and Private Housing Shaped Suburban Connecticut” in the *Journal of Urban History* (2012), with support from a National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation post-doctoral fellowship. In collaboration with Trinity College economist Diane Zannoni and their students, he co-authored social science and policy analyses on “School Choice in Suburbia: Test Scores, Race, and Housing Markets” in the *American Journal of Education* (2009), and the "School Information, Parental Decisions, and the Digital Divide" book chapter (2013). Also, Jack co-edited two open-access volumes (*Writing History in the Digital Age*, with Kristen Nawrotzki, University of Michigan Press, 2013) and (*Web Writing: Why and How for Liberal Arts Teaching and Learning*, with Tennyson O'Donnell, University of Michigan Press, 2015), and he is working on an open-access textbook (*Data Visualization for All*, with Ilya Ilyankou). Currently, Jack and student contributors are completing an open-access book, *On The Line: How Schooling, Housing, and Civil Rights Shaped Hartford and its Suburbs* (under contract with Amherst College Press), which blends historical narrative with interactive maps and video interviews, and has been supported by a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

For two decades, Jack has taught and advised hundreds of undergraduate students at Trinity, one of the nation's preeminent liberal arts colleges in a city. Over 25 undergraduates have co-authored publications or co-presented papers with him at national academic conferences such as the American Educational Research Association, the History of Education Society, the Oral History Association, and the National Council on Public History. As Director of the Educational Studies Program, he designed and led courses such as:
- the introductory Educ 200: Analyzing Schools course, which compares theories of learning and inequality with participant-observation experiences in Hartford public school classrooms
- the mid-level history and policy survey, Educ 300: Education Reform, Past & Present
- research project seminars such as Educ 308: Cities, Suburbs, and Schools, and Educ 309: Race, Class, and Ed Policy
- the Educ 350: Teaching and Learning seminar, where students design and lead inquiry-based math or science lessons in Hartford elementary and middle schools
- the capstone Educ 400: Senior Research Seminar, where all majors propose, conduct, and present a study using qualitative, quantitative, and/or historical methods

As the inaugural Director of the [Center for Hartford Engagement and Research](http://cher.trincoll.edu) (CHER), Jack leads a team of nine staff and an annual combined budget of $1 million to strengthen educational partnerships between the campus and the city's diverse neighborhoods. Working together, the team accomplishments include:
- launch of the Liberal Arts Action Lab, where Hartford community partners propose research questions to be answered by teams of Trinity College and Capital Community College students and faculty fellows
- startup of the Public Humanities Collaborative, a summer research program for Trinity students to partner with Hartford organizations and Trinity faculty, funded by the Mellon Foundation
- expansion of professional development for faculty who teach Community Learning courses that connect with the city
- richer assessment of the quality of Trinity's engagement with Hartford through community partner focus groups and neighborhood resident door-to-door interviews in Spanish and English
- improved communications between campus and the community through social media, videos, and monthly newsletter
