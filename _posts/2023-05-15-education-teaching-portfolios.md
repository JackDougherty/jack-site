Watching teaching is simple. But looking for *authentic* student learning is harder because sometimes it can be more difficult to see. While people can point to grade reports and test scores, when do "aha" moments of student learning actually happen in the classroom? And how do you persuade people who were not inside your classroom that those key moments actually happened?

"Show Us the Learning" is one of my mantras when working with novice teachers, and one of the best strategies I can offer is to guide them in creating online teaching portfolios. In my [Educ 350: Teaching and Learning](https://jackdougherty.org/educ350) course in 2023, Trinity students design and teach three inquiry-based math or science workshops requested by Grade 3-7 teachers at two partnering Hartford public schools. To document their intellectual work as newer teachers, Trinity students create portfolios of their lesson plans, followed by images and edited video clips of student learning in their classrooms, and personal reflections on what work and what they might do different next time. In the same way that Peter Liljedahl's *Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics* (2021) suggests ways to make students' *mathematical thinking* more visible (such as using vertical non-permanent writing surfaces or whiteboards to illustrate different approaching to problem-solving), my teaching portfolios make our *pedagogical thinking* more visible to illustrate different approaches to our craft as educators, with the broader goal of deeper classroom learning. Also, sharing teaching portfolios on the public web -- with protections for individual student privacy -- help novice teachers share their skills with graduate schools, future employers, and other educators across the globe.

See this [sample teaching portfolio by Trinity College student Jess Cruz](https://jessicacruz.domains.trincoll.edu), who designed and led a series of mathematics workshops on adding and subtracting decimals with 5th grade students. [In Jess's final workshop](https://jessicacruz.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3-feed-the-monster-let-the-beast-feast/), her class played two different math games, each using word problems written by students, to compare differences between the games and help them reflect on which strategy most helped them improve their learning. For more sample teaching portfolios, see [my summary of the Spring 2023 course with screenshots and links](/2023/05/08/reflections-educ350/).
