We compiled and mapped over 250 homes for lower-income families created during the past three decades with the Hartford-area branch of Habitat for Humanity, now called [Habitat for Humanity North Central Connecticut](https://hfhncc.org). Around the globe, Habitat for Humanity helps people build, repair, and finance their homes to achieve their goal of decent housing for all. As a class project for my [Data Visualization for All](https://datavizforall.org) course in Fall 2021, the Hartford-area Habitat branch partnered with us to compile a dataset of over 250 homes they had created since the 1990s. My students cleaned the data, linked it to local government assessor public records, and visualized it in [an interactive map](https://datavizforall.org/habitat-homes-map/) to show growth in city and suburban areas by decade. In additional, [Trinity students published data stories](https://datavizforall.org/partners-projects/#hartford-area-habitat-for-humanity-and-housing) that analyzed the census tract demographics where Habitat homes were created over time, and the $850,000 in total property taxes they generate annually for local governments.
