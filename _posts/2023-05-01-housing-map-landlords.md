Which landlords own the most property? To answer this question for the Parkville neighborhood of Hartford Connecticut, I coached my Trinity College student Victoria Asfalg on how to analyze and map parcel-level property assessment data, in partnership with researcher Zoe Chatfield for her MA thesis at Clark University in 2023. Together, they focused on the Parkville neighborhood due to recent high-profile real estate developments and speculation that land values will sharply increase in this residential area with many lower-income families near downtown Hartford. Asfalg built on her skills as a former student and teaching assistant in my [Data Visualization for All course](https://datavizforall.org) to complete this senior exercise for her Urban Studies major. She downloaded city assessor records for all properties in the neighborhood, cleaned and pivoted the data to match and group by ownership, and identified the largest landlords in three ways: by number of parcels, number of living units, and total appraised value. For her data story, Asfalg created interactive tables and maps to identify the largest residential and commercial landlords in the neighborhood, and also to illustrate how property use has shifted over the past two decades.
