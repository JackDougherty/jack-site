Sometimes, getting angry motivates you to get stuff done. Tonight my spouse Beth Rose and I designed our new lawn sign to speak out against Trump monarchical words and actions, with a flag-centric message to remind people of our nation's united stance in favor of democracy. After all, what's more American than "Rejecting Kings" since Independence Day?

We publicly shared the [PDF link](/images/2025/rejecting-kings.pdf) and [Canva link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGf-BEoG_w/w2hOEGX-mQ0cvTXDXJvL9g/edit?utm_content=DAGf-BEoG_w&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) for people to download and print their own, or modify as they wish.

The asterisk with the historical footnote was Beth's idea. Many state residents have heard the [Legend of Connecticut's Charter Oak of 1687](https://connecticuthistory.org/the-legend-of-the-charter-oak/). When England's King James II sought to reassert control over the colony, he appointed a new governor to confiscate the previous charter that had granted self-governance. Allegedly, during a nighttime debate at Old State House in Hartford, opponents of the King's rule blew out the candles and whisked away the charter document to hide it inside a large hollow oak tree, later known as the "Charter Oak."

But Beth (and our neighbor Bill) also taught me that anti-monarchy sentiment goes back even earlier. [Connecticut played a key role in hiding three judges involved in the 1649 Regicide](https://todayincthistory.com/2020/03/07/march-7-english-regicides-flee-to-new-haven-2/), when 59 English Puritan judges put King Charles I on trial for tyranny against their nation, found him guilty, and signed the death warrant for his execution. After a turbulent decade, pro-monarchy forces restored his son to the throne as King Charles II, who sought vengeance against the Puritan "regicides," or king killers. Eventually, three of them -- Edward Whalley, William Goffe, and John Dixwell -- fled to New Haven, Connecticut, where two of them temporarily lived in the West Rock area currently known as "Judges' Cave". Three major roads bear their names.

So in late February, we took our design to a local print shop and ordered 50 lawn signs. We posted two on our corner lot, snapped a cute pic with Oscar the dog peeking through the fence, and circulated our offer to neighbors and friends, asking $10 donation to cover our printing costs. Our front porch became a small cottage industry for people to pick up their signs, tagged with their names on blue masking tape. The neighborhood started to bloom with spring flowers and lawn signs. Our first batch sold out in one week.

Beth and I thought we were done, but two neighbors kindly frontly most of the cash for a second batch of 100 signs.
