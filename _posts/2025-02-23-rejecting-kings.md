Sometimes, getting angry motivates you to get stuff done. Tonight my spouse Beth Rose and I designed our new lawn sign to speak out against Trump, with a flag-centric message to remind people of our nation's united stance against monarchies:

Rejecting Kings Since 1776   
(even earlier in Connecticut)

We decided to share this [PDF download link](https://jackdougherty.org/images/2025/rejecting-kings.pdf) for people print their own, and also this [link to our Canva design](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGf-BEoG_w/w2hOEGX-mQ0cvTXDXJvL9g/edit?utm_content=DAGf-BEoG_w&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) for people to modify as they wish. We intentionally shared both under a [CC0 Public Domain license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

The asterisk with the historical footnote was Beth's idea. Many state residents have heard the [Legend of Connecticut's Charter Oak of 1687](https://connecticuthistory.org/the-legend-of-the-charter-oak/). When England's King James II sought to reassert control over the colony, he appointed a new governor to confiscate the previous charter that had granted self-governance. Allegedly, during a nighttime debate at Old State House in Hartford, opponents of the King's rule blew out the candles and whisked away the charter document to hide it inside a large hollow oak tree, later known as the "Charter Oak."

Yet Beth (and our neighbor Bill) also taught me that anti-monarchy sentiment goes back even earlier. [Connecticut played a key role in hiding three judges involved in the 1649 Regicide](https://todayincthistory.com/2020/03/07/march-7-english-regicides-flee-to-new-haven-2/), when 59 English Puritan judges put King Charles I on trial for tyranny against their nation, found him guilty, and signed the death warrant for his execution. After a turbulent decade, pro-monarchy forces restored his son to the throne as King Charles II, who sought vengeance against the Puritan "regicides," or king killers. Eventually, three of them -- Edward Whalley, William Goffe, and John Dixwell -- fled to New Haven, Connecticut, where two of them temporarily lived in the West Rock area currently known as "Judges' Cave". Three major roads bear their names.
