To help preserve affordable homeownership, we mapped one of the oldest and largest shared equity land trust housing programs in the Northeastern US, in partnership with the [Center for Leadership and Justice](https://cljct.org) (CLJ) in Hartford CT. Shared equity land trusts, also known as [community land trusts](https://groundedsolutions.org/strengthening-neighborhoods/community-land-trusts/), allow lower-income buyers to purchase a home while the trust maintains ownership of the land to block speculators and assure that future resale prices remain affordable. As a class project for my [Data Visualization for All](https://datavizforall.org) course in Fall 2024, students and I cleaned up CLJ's dataset of 211 properties in this 30-year-old homeownership program, and linked the data to present-day public assessor records to analyze trends. Nellie Conklin published [her data story](https://datavizforall.org/clt-conklin/) that mapped the general location of these single- and multi-family properties in the Hartford region, and compared CLJ's program to similar homeownership initiatives across the Northeast. CLJ staff worked with Conklin to [republish her map on their website](https://cljct.org/usa/). Note: to maintain privacy for individual homeowners, as requested by CLJ, we masked street addresses and removed zoom controls [in the map below](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/k8d6H/1/).
