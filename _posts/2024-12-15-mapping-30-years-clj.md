To help preserve affordable homeownership, we mapped home locations for one of the oldest and largest shared equity land trust housing programs in the Northeastern US, in partnership with the [Center for Leadership and Justice](https://cljct.org) (CLJ) in Hartford CT. Shared equity land trusts (also known as community land trusts) allows low-to-middle income buyers to purchase the home, while the trust maintains ownership of the land to assure that future resale prices are still affordable. As a class project for my Data Visualization for All course in Fall 2024, my students and I cleaned up CLJ's dataset of 211 properties in this 30-year-old homeownership program, and linked the data to present-day public assessor records to analyze trends. Teaching Assistant Nellie Conklin published [her data story](https://datavizforall.org/clt-conklin/) that mapped the general location of these single-family and multi-family properties in the Hartford region, and compared CLJ's program to similar homeownership initiatives in the Northeast. CLJ staff [republished the map on their website](https://cljct.org/usa/). Note: to maintain privacy for individual homeowners, as requested by CLJ, we masked street addresses and removed zoom controls [in the map below](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3tSnU/2/).
