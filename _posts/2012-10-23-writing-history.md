Yesterday afternoon, co-editor Kristen Nawrotzki and I, along with over thirty contributors, heard that the University of Michigan Press approved publication of our peer-reviewed edited volume, _<a title="WHDA" href="http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu" target="_blank">Writing History in the Digital Age</a>_, which is openly available online. Earlier that morning, Kristen and I participated in an online video interview about the project with Korey Jackson from Anvil Academic, a new open-access humanities press supported by NITLE, CLIR, and several higher education institutions. Learn more and check out the video clips on thisÂ <a title="WHDA" href="http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu/2012/10/approved/" target="_blank">announcement</a>. Together, this was a great kick-off for <a title="OAWeek" href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/" target="_blank">Open Access Week</a>.
