Join us for a discussion, &#8220;Careers with a Conscience: Ed Studies Alumni in Non-Profits and Government,&#8221; on Sunday, April 15th, 2012, from 6:30-7:30pm, in Seabury S205 at Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut.

We have invited alumni who have worked in non-profit organizations and governmental agencies across several fields, including youth development, family and children&#8217;s services, school finance, fair and affordable housing, libraries & museums, and other areas. Each guest will speak for five minutes to share their experience and offer advice to current Trinity students, with time for Q&A and discussion. Some will speak via online videoconference and others will join us in person. 

This event follows up on a related discussion about <a href="http://jackdougherty.org/2011/10/15/discuss-pathways-to-teaching/" target="_blank">&#8220;Pathways to Teaching&#8221; with Trinity alumni in October 2011</a>, which focused on classroom teachers. We plan to host more discussions like these in the years to come.
