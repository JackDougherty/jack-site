Our partner organization, [CASBHC: The Connecticut Association of School Based Health Centers](https://ctschoolhealth.org/), advocates for medical, dental, and mental health services that are offered at no cost to students in over 300 public schools across the state. But they needed help answering questions for the next phase of their healthy equity work. First, which CT public schools do *not* have these centers, and how do their student demographics compare to schools that have them? Second, how many of these school based health centers are located in each state legislator's district? Students in my [Data Visualization for All class in Fall 2025](https://datavizforall.org/partners-projects/#school-based-health-centers) answered these questions. First, we linked CASBHC's dataset of 300+ school based health centers to a larger CT Department of Education dataset of over 2000 public schools and programs, along with student enrollment data by grade, race, and social class. Second, students such as [Emma Conard and Darian Mehran-Lodge](https://datavizforall.org/schools-conard-mehran-lodge/) spatially joined the location of each school to state legislative boundaries, to map political power and state funding that currently supports school based health centers.
