The University of Michigan Press shared this <a href="http://www.digitalculture.org/2013/10/07/now-available-writing-history-in-the-digital-age/" target="_blank">announcement</a> today:

> We are proud to announce the latest title from digitalculturebooks, [Writing History in the Digital Age](http://www.digitalculture.org/books/writing-history-in-the-digital-age/) edited by Kristen Nawrotzki and Jack Dougherty. This book is the third title in our Digital Humanities series and began as a “what-if” experiment by posing a question: How have Internet technologies influenced how historians think, teach, author, and publish?
>
> To facilitate this innovative volume, Dougherty and Nawrotzki designed a born-digital, open-access, and open peer review process to capture commentary from appointed experts and general readers. A customized WordPress plug-in allowed audiences to add page- and paragraph-level comments to the manuscript, transforming it into a socially networked text. The finished product now presents 20 essays from a wide array of notable scholars, each examining (and then breaking apart and reexamining) if and how digital and emergent technologies have changed the historical profession.

Good thing I checked my RSS feed this evening, as that&#8217;s how I found out that the book was published today!
