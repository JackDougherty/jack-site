To make problems and solutions more publicly visible, street safety advocates and I created several on-site short videos for social media channels in West Hartford, Connecticut. Our most successful short videos featured urban planners and parents who spoke directly to the camera to share their first-hand perspectives, with on-screen graphics to emphasize their points. We shot video with smartphones and [Rode wireless microphones](https://rode.com/en-us/products/wireless-micro) for clearer outdoor narration, and edited in Canva, a tool already familiar to the organization, to quickly produce one-minute shorts for social media and newsletters.
