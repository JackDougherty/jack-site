Ken Krayeske and Joe Barber invited me to ride with the Trinity Pre-Orientation cyclists this year, but those plans fell apart when I injured my hand earlier this month. So I was delighted when they stopped by my house this morning for a lemonade break and chat about cities and suburbs. Looking forward to riding with them in the future.
