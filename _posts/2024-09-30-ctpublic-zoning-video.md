Connecticut Public Television invited me to partner with them to explain the rise of exclusionary zoning laws and their impact on the state's housing affordability crisis for their 2024 documentary, [Fighting For Home: How Housing Policy Keeps Connecticut Segregated](https://www.ctpublic.org/watch/local-programming/fighting-for-home). In addition to narrating [this five-minute segment](https://youtu.be/VCvtTLOLSgo?si=IZWuuQ8HRtECUadu&t=545) of the one-hour documentary, I advised them on integrating historical images and interactive maps into the video to illustrate the hard-to-see rules of zoning. These digital images and maps appear in a chapter of my open-access book, [On The Line: How Schooling, Housing, and Civil Rights Shaped Hartford and its Suburbs](https://ontheline.trincoll.edu). Also, [Connecticut Explored magazine published this illustrated excerpt about zoning](https://www.ctexplored.org/game-changer-the-rise-of-exclusionary-zoning-in-connecticut/) from my book as part of their Game Changer innovation awards in 2023.
