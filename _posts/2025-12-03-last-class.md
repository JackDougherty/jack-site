Students joined me to celebrate my last two class sessions after 26 years of teaching at Trinity College (1999-2025). This fall I taught two back-to-back sections of [Educ 206: Data Visualization for All](https://datavizforall.org), where we partnered with two CT non-profit organizations to create data stories with interactive charts and maps. I'm very pleased that every student in both classes completed their online data stories, attended our final in-person class, and decided to join me in front of the camera with smiles! I'm very proud to have finished on a high note, with several of my students producing some of the highest-quality data stories during my time teaching this course. Next week they deliver two-minute highlights of their data stories and participate in Q&A with a panel of guest experts on Zoom. Now I'm ready to #FlunkRetirement by starting up new projects with community groups in my new home in Boston.
