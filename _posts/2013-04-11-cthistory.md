Last summer I sat down with colleagues at <a href="http://connecticuthistory.org" target="_blank">ConnecticutHistory.org</a> to brainstorm ways of partnering together to document African-American and civil rights history in the Hartford region. In this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuWg9Jrkrpw&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a>, students from my <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/cssp" target="_blank">Cities, Suburbs, and Schools seminar</a> discuss what they learned about the process of writing for broader audiences through this open-access web publication. So far, essays published by my Trinity students include:

Victoria Smith-Ellison, “<a href="http://connecticuthistory.org/hartfords-great-migration-through-charles-s-johnsons-eyes/" target="_blank">Hartford’s Great Migration Through Charles S. Johnson’s Eyes</a>,” _ConnecticutHistory.org_, February 2013.

Mary Daly, “<a href="http://connecticuthistory.org/race-restrictive-covenants-in-property-deeds" target="_blank">Race Restrictive Covenants in Property Deeds</a>,” _ConnecticutHistory.org_, January 2013.

Nicole Sagullo, “<a href="http://connecticuthistory.org/how-real-estate-practices-influenced-the-hartford-regions-demographic-makeup" target="_blank">How Real Estate Practices Influenced the Hartford Region’s Demographic Makeup</a>,” _ConnecticutHistory.org_, February 2013.

Amanda Gurren, “<a href="http://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-takes-the-wheel-on-education-reform-project-concern" target="_blank">Connecticut Takes the Wheel on Education Reform: Project Concern</a>,” _ConnecticutHistory.org_, April 2013.
