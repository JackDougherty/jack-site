This is not an example of good timing, but I&#8217;m learning that there are some things over which we have no control. Over the past few days, eagle-eyed co-editor Kristen Nawrotzki and I finished reviewing the final proof pages for one book, <a href="http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu" target="_blank">Writing History in the Digital Age</a> (forthcoming from the University of Michigan Press in fall 2013 and available online now), and my Trinity College co-editors (Dina Anselmi, Chris Hager, Jason Jones, and Tennyson O&#8217;Donnell) and I just launched the open peer review for another book, <a href="http://webwriting.trincoll.edu" target="_blank">Web Writing: Why and How for Liberal Arts Teaching and Learning</a> (under contract with Michigan Publishing and also available now online). Good thing my twelve-year-old baked a delicious batch of amazing fudge brownies to help keep me going during this marathon stretch.
