*When assigning the final reflective essay to students in my [Educ 350: Teaching and Learning](https://jackdougherty.org/educ350) course at Trinity College, I decided to place myself in their role and write my own reflections about my growth as an educator this semester.

Jessica Cruz designed and led a series of mathematics workshops on adding and subtracting decimals with 5th grade students. [In Jess's final workshop](https://jessicacruz.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3-feed-the-monster-let-the-beast-feast/), her class played two different math games, each using word problems written by students, to compare differences between the games and to evaluate which most helped to improve their learning.

Alberlis Hernandez created and taught three hands-on inquiry-based 5th grade science lessons about forces and motion. In her final lesson, [students experimented with the force of static electricity](https://alberlishernandez.domains.trincoll.edu/workshop-3-electric-charge/) by rubbing balloons to create a charge and testing whether it was strong enough to move different types of materials: paper dots, crispy rice cereal, and styrofoam peanuts.

Sloane Latimer designed and led 7th grade science workshops on multiple topics. In [Sloane's final lesson on renewable energy](https://slatimer.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3/), she led her students in comparing renewable energy collected from mini solar panels to power a small motor versus non-renewable energy stored inside a battery.

Sonia Lau created and taught three hands-on science lessons with different 5th grade classrooms. [In Sonia's second lesson on phases of the Moon](https://yantungsonialau.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-2-ahh-it-is-so-bright/), students moved spheres in their orbits around a bright light, representing the Sun, to simulate how we on Earth perceive light to create different phases: new moon to half moon to full moon.

Maria Markosyan designed and led hands-on workshops that emphasized scientific thinking with 4th grade students. [In their first lesson on creating energy with renewable resources](https://mariamarkosyan.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-1/), students compared the pros and cons of powering small bulbs and motors with hand-crank generators, batteries, and mini solar cells.

Xavier Mercado innovated with different strategies to help 4th grade students add and multiple fractions greater than one. In [Xavier's final lesson based on the Fortnite video game](https://xaviermercado.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3-fortnite-fractions/), students needed to maximize their purchase of quantities of game materials (such as wood and shields) using a price list written in fractions.

Marie Naka created three different hands-on science lessons to promote deeper scientific thinking with 4th grade students. [In Marie's final lesson on the Eggciting Eggsperiment](https://marienaka.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3-eggciting-eggsperiment/), students tested different strategies to reduce the effect of gravity on a falling egg, using materials such as cotton balls and popsicle sticks.

Maria Vicuña innovated with strategies for teaching mathematical thinking with 4th grade students. [In Maria's second lesson on equivalent fractions](https://mariavicuna.domains.trincoll.edu/equivalent-fractions/), she created color-coded fraction bars to help students visualize equal proportions of fractions with different numerators and denominators.

Shelley Xia created and taught three different workshops to promote deeper scientific thinking with 4th grade students. [In Shelley's final lesson on earthquakes](https://shelleyxia.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3/), she led students through an activity to design, build, and test earthquake-resistant structures using model buildings they constructed and experimented with on a "shake table."
