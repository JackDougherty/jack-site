Discussion and lunch sponsored by the Academic (Technology) Roundtable, [Center for Faculty Career Development](http://www.wesleyan.edu/cfcd/atr/index.html), Wesleyan University

Have online writing and editing tools changed how you and your students collaborate in (or outside of) class? Or have you considered publishing your next peer-reviewed journal article, or perhaps a digital book, with an open-access scholarly press? Explore these questions with **Mark Edington, **Director of [Amherst College Press](https://acpress.amherst.edu/), a digital-first open access publisher, and **Jack Dougherty, **Harber Fellow in Education and Entrepreneurship at Wesleyan and Associate Professor of Educational Studies at Trinity College.

Two years ago, I spoke a Wesleyan ATR session while working on my first open-access book: Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki, eds., _Writing History in the Digital Age_ (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2013). The book explores questions such as: Has the digital revolution transformed how we write about the past — or not? Have new technologies changed our essential work-craft as scholars, and the ways in which we think, teach, author, and publish? Does the digital age have broader implications for individual writing processes, or for the historical profession at large? Available both in print (for sale) and online (for free) at <http://www.digitalculture.org/books/writing-history-in-the-digital-age/>

Jack Dougherty and Tennyson O&#8217;Donnell are co-editors of a brand-new volume, [_Web Writing: Why and How for Liberal Arts Teaching and Learning_](http://webwriting.trincoll.edu). This open-access book explores why online writing matters for liberal arts learning and illustrates how different faculty teach with web-based tools for authoring, annotating, peer editing, and publishing. Purchase a print edition from the [University of Michigan Press](http://www.press.umich.edu/8291956/), or freely read online or download e-book editions at [WebWriting.trincoll.edu](http://webwriting.trincoll.edu).
