*When assigning the final reflective essay to students in my [Educ 350: Teaching and Learning](https://jackdougherty.org/educ350) course at Trinity College, I decided to place myself in their role and write my own reflections about my growth as an educator this semester.

DRAFT THEMES on Show Us the Learning: Building Thinking Classrooms

TODO: Introduce readers to my Trinity course design and how students were assigned to design, teach, and create web portfolios on three math or science lessons they created for Hartford G3-7 classrooms. Emphasize these aspects:

- inquiry-based discovery learning and building thinking classrooms
- pandemic recovery challenges: Trinity students had less experience in Hartford classrooms, and Hartford teachers had more stress than usual

## Highlights from Trinity Student Teaching Portfolios
One lesson I previously learned before this semester is the value of students sharing their work on the public web.
Quote from Web Writing chapter, and also point out privacy issues, meaning that students own their words

When our Educ 350 class read Peter L's Building Thinking Classrooms, one parallel that stood out is his emphasis on using vertical non-permanent writing surfaces (aka whiteboards) to make students' *mathematical thinking* more visible in the classroom. In one sense, requiring my Trinity students to create public web portfolios of their teaching makes their *pedagogical thinking* more visible, not just in our classroom, but to anyone on the web, including their future prospective employers or graduate programs.

Jessica Cruz designed and led a series of mathematics workshops on adding and subtracting decimals with 5th grade students. [In Jess's final workshop](https://jessicacruz.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3-feed-the-monster-let-the-beast-feast/), her class played two different math games, each using word problems written by students, to compare differences between the games and to evaluate which most helped to improve their learning.

Alberlis Hernandez created and taught three hands-on inquiry-based 5th grade science lessons about forces and motion. In her final lesson, [students experimented with the force of static electricity](https://alberlishernandez.domains.trincoll.edu/workshop-3-electric-charge/) by rubbing balloons to create a charge and testing whether it was strong enough to move different types of materials: paper dots, crispy rice cereal, and styrofoam peanuts.

Sloane Latimer designed and led 7th grade science workshops on multiple topics. In [Sloane's final lesson on renewable energy](https://slatimer.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3/), she led her students in comparing renewable energy collected from mini solar panels to power a small motor versus non-renewable energy stored inside a battery.

Sonia Lau created and taught three hands-on science lessons with different 5th grade classrooms. [In Sonia's second lesson on phases of the Moon](https://yantungsonialau.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-2-ahh-it-is-so-bright/), students moved spheres in their orbits around a bright light, representing the Sun, to simulate how we on Earth perceive light to create different phases: new moon to half moon to full moon.

Maria Markosyan designed and led hands-on workshops that emphasized scientific thinking with 4th grade students. [In their first lesson on creating energy with renewable resources](https://mariamarkosyan.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-1/), students compared the pros and cons of powering small bulbs and motors with hand-crank generators, batteries, and mini solar cells.

Xavier Mercado innovated with different strategies to help 4th grade students add and multiple fractions greater than one. In [Xavier's final lesson based on the Fortnite video game](https://xaviermercado.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3-fortnite-fractions/), students needed to maximize their purchase of quantities of game materials (such as wood and shields) using a price list written in fractions.

Marie Naka created three different hands-on science lessons to promote deeper scientific thinking with 4th grade students. [In Marie's final lesson on the Eggciting Eggsperiment](https://marienaka.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3-eggciting-eggsperiment/), students tested different strategies to reduce the effect of gravity on a falling egg, using materials such as cotton balls and popsicle sticks.

Maria Vicuña innovated with strategies for teaching mathematical thinking with 4th grade students. [In Maria's second lesson on equivalent fractions](https://mariavicuna.domains.trincoll.edu/equivalent-fractions/), she created color-coded fraction bars to help students visualize equal proportions of fractions with different numerators and denominators.

Shelley Xia created and taught three different workshops to promote deeper scientific thinking with 4th grade students. [In Shelley's final lesson on earthquakes](https://shelleyxia.domains.trincoll.edu/lesson-3/), she led students through an activity to design, build, and test earthquake-resistant structures using model buildings they constructed and experimented with on a "shake table."

How do I answer the same questions I posed to my Trinity students? IN other words, how an I show how my Trinity students learned how to build thinking classrooms this semester? Just saying it happened is not persuasive.

## Noticeable shifts from traditional teaching to inquiry-based learning


1) Significant improvement in shifting from "traditional teacher talk" to more "student disovery" inquiry-based learning
- difficult at first write higher-level thinking objectives; difficult to translatte "guiding questions" into your your actual lessons; I was giving some very strong critiques about ways to improve lesson plans

## Stronger Peer-to-Peer Reviewing Changed My Teaching Role
2) over the semester, noticed that through peer reviews of lesson plans and portfolios, notices how students advised each other more deeply (examples...., and this shifted me to listening more to peer-to-peer exchange)

3)
