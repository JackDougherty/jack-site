*When assigning the final reflective essay to students in my [Educ 350: Teaching and Learning](https://jackdougherty.org/educ350) course at Trinity College, I decided to place myself in their role and write my own reflections about my growth as an educator this semester.

DRAFT THEMES on Show Us the Learning: Building Thinking Classrooms

TODO: Introduce readers to my Trinity course design and how students were assigned to design, teach, and create web portfolios on three math or science lessons they created for Hartford G3-7 classrooms. Emphasize these aspects:

- inquiry-based discovery learning and building thinking classrooms
- pandemic recovery challenges: Trinity students had less experience in Hartford classrooms, and Hartford teachers had more stress than usual

## Highlights from Trinity Student Teaching Portfolios
One lesson I previously learned before this semester is the value of students sharing their work on the public web.
Quote from Web Writing chapter, and also point out privacy issues, meaning that students own their words

When our Educ 350 class read Peter L's Building Thinking Classrooms, one parallel that stood out is his emphasis on using vertical non-permanent writing surfaces (aka whiteboards) to make students' *mathematical thinking* more visible in the classroom. In one sense, requiring my Trinity students to create public web portfolios of their teaching makes their *pedagogical thinking* more visible, not just in our classroom, but to anyone on the web, including their future prospective employers or graduate programs.

How do I answer the same questions I posed to my Trinity students? IN other words, how an I show how my Trinity students learned how to build thinking classrooms this semester? Just saying it happened is not persuasive.

## Noticeable shifts from traditional teaching to inquiry-based learning


1) Significant improvement in shifting from "traditional teacher talk" to more "student disovery" inquiry-based learning
- difficult at first write higher-level thinking objectives; difficult to translatte "guiding questions" into your your actual lessons; I was giving some very strong critiques about ways to improve lesson plans

## Stronger Peer-to-Peer Reviewing Changed My Teaching Role
2) over the semester, noticed that through peer reviews of lesson plans and portfolios, notices how students advised each other more deeply (examples...., and this shifted me to listening more to peer-to-peer exchange)

3)
