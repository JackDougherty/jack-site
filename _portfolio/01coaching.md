Digital strategy coaching available to community groups and non-profit organizations in the Boston area and beyond.

Let's meet up to listen to your goals and the challenges you face. Let's discuss how to make your organization's steps toward meaning change more visible to your desired audiences, by using better data, interactive maps, and digital storytelling tools and methods.

I specialize in finding customized solutions that are low-cost, easy-to-learn, and sustainable for small-to-medium-sized organizations, and teaching your team how to use them to achieve your goals. See recent examples of my work with community groups on topics including [affordable housing](/housing), [educational equity](/education), [safer streets for all](/streets), and [environmental justice](/environment).

Schedule a [free 30-minute Zoom meeting on my calendar](/calendar) to discuss what's on your mind. If we decide to partner with each other, here's some key steps in the process, with questions to think about ahead of time:

1. Strategize
  - What's the mission of your organization?
  - What are some of the challenges you face in meeting those goals?
  - How does your team make priorities on how to spend limited time and resources?

2. Investigate
  - How do you know when your organization achieves some success, either large or small?
  - What kinds of information do you collect in your work for change?
  - What's a question you wish you could answer about your organization's work for change?

3. Visualize
  - Let's make a quick sketch of your organization's work for change. What does it look like?
  - What types of changes led by your organization are hard for some people to see and understand?
  - How might we visualize change with charts or maps? Or people's stories or short videos?

4. Tell Your Story
  - What kinds of people are you trying to reach with your story?
  - What parts of your story of change are hardest for people to grasp and understand?
  - What digital storytelling strategies can we include into your current work, without making too much additional work?

After our first meeting, additional coaching services are available for a modest fee. Upon request, I will send you a proposal and price for a specific project and time period.
