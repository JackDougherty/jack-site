Digital strategy coaching services are available to community groups and non-profit organizations in Boston and beyond. **Schedule a [free 30-minute Zoom meeting on my calendar](/calendar) to discuss what's on your mind**.

Let's meet up to listen to your goals and the challenges you face. Let's find ways to **make your work for change more visible** with better data, interactive charts and maps, and digital storytelling tools to reach your desired audiences.

I specialize in designing low-cost and easy-to-learn digital solutions that are customized to the specific needs of small-to-medium sized organizations. Also, I teach you and your team how to sustainably manage your digital tools and avoid paying unnecessary high-cost subscriptions. See recent examples of my partnerships with people working for change on [housing](/housing), [education](/education), [safer streets](/streets), and [storytelling with short videos](/storytelling).

Overview of my coaching process, with reflection questions to help focus our conversation:

1. Strategize
  - What's your organization's story of change? What's your mission and how do you make it work?
  - What are some challenges your organization faces while working toward your goals?
  - How do you and your team prioritize how to spend your limited time and resources?

2. Investigate
  - What's a question you wish you could answer about your work for change?
  - What kinds of information do you currently collect while doing your work?
  - How do you know when your organization achieves some success, either large or small?

3. Visualize
  - Let's sketch a picture of your organization's work for change. What does it look like?
  - What key parts of your work for change are hidden from view, or hard for other people to see?
  - How can we visualize your story of change with a chart or map? Or images or short video?

4. Tell Your Story
  - Who do you currently reach with your story of change? Who do you wish you could reach?
  - What  for most people to grasp about your story of change?
  - What digital storytelling strategies can we include into your current work, without making too much additional work?
